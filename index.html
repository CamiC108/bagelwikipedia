			<h1>The introduction of kosher bagels</h1>
			<h3>In Japan, the first kosher bagels were brought by BagelK from New York in 1989. BagelK created green tea, chocolate, maple-nut, and banana-nut flavors for the market in Japan.</h3>

				<h1> The "bagel brunch" became popular</h1>
				<h3>Around 1900, the "bagel brunch" became popular in New York City.  The bagel brunch consists of a bagel topped with lox, cream cheese, capers, tomato, and red onion. This and similar combinations of toppings have remained associated with bagels into the 21st century in the United States.</h3>

				<h1>Emergence in the United States</h1>
				<h3>Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338. They had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand.</h3>

				<h1>Bagels have been sold in London</h1>
				<h3>In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels (locally spelled "beigels") have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.</h3>

				<h1>A staple of Polish cuisine</h1>
				<h3>In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine. Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning 'ring' or 'bracelet'.</h3>

			<h1>The Bagels’ Ingredient</h1>
			<h3>At its most basic, traditional bagel dough contains wheat flour (without germ or bran), salt, water, and yeast leavening. Bread flour or other high gluten flours are preferred to create the firm, dense but spongy bagel shape and chewy texture. With a dough hydration of around 50–57%, bagel dough is among the stiffest bread doughs. Most bagel recipes call for the addition of a sweetener to the dough, often barley malt (syrup or crystals), honey, high fructose corn syrup, or sugar, with or without eggs, milk or butter. Leavening can be accomplished using a sourdough technique or a commercially produced yeast.</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="info b2">
			<h1>How to Make Bagels</h1>
			<h3>Bagels are traditionally made by:
				mixing and kneading the ingredients to form the dough
				shaping the dough into the traditional bagel shape, round with a hole in the middle, from a long thin piece of dough
				proofing the bagels for at least 12 hours at low temperature (40–50 °F (4–10 °C))
				boiling each bagel for 60–90 seconds in water that may contain additives such as lye, baking soda, barley malt syrup, or honey
				baking at a temperature between 347–599 °F (175–315 °C)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="info b3">
			<h1>The Steam Bagel</h1>
			<h3>In recent years, a variant has emerged, producing what is sometimes called the steam bagel. To make a steam bagel, the boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a steam injection system.[26] In commercial bagel production, the steam bagel process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be removed from their pans as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam bagel results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a finger roll that happens to be shaped like a bagel. The dough used is intentionally more alkaline to aid browning, because the steam injection process uses neutral water steam instead of an alkaline solution bath.</h3>

				<h3>The New York bagel contains malt, is cold-fermented for several days to develop the flavors and enhance the crust, and is boiled in salted water before baking in a standard oven. The resulting bagel has a fluffy interior and a chewy crust.</h3>

				<h3>Different from the New York style, the Montreal-style bagel contains malt and sugar with no salt; it is boiled in honey-sweetened water before baking in a wood-fired oven. It is predominantly of the sesame "white" seeds variety (bagels in Toronto are similar to those made in New York in that they are less sweet, generally are coated with poppy seeds and are baked in a standard oven).</h3>

				<h2>St.Louis Style Bagel</h2>
				<h3>The St. Louis style bagel refers not to composition, but to a particular method of slicing the bagel. The St. Louis style bagels are sliced vertically multiple times, instead of the traditional single horizontal slice. The slices range from 3 to 6 mm (0.12 to 0.24 in) thick. Generally, the bagels are sliced into eight pieces using a bread slicer, which produces characteristically precise cuts (the bagel is not torn or crushed while slicing). </h3>
